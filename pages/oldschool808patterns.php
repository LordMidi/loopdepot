        Oldschool 808 Patterns
        <small> - 150 drum sequences for Reason</small>
      </h1>
      <h3>Start the oldschool jam now!</h3>
      <p>
        We all know and love the sound of the legendary 808 drum computer.
        In the 1980s, its <strong>massive bass</strong> and <strong>snappy snare</strong> laid the foundation for the era of <strong>electro funk & freestyle music</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The oldschool lovers of Loop Depot recreated <strong>110 of the most iconic drum patterns of all times</strong>.
        We tried to keep it as true as possible to the originals.
        As a bonus, we included <strong>40 additional drum sequences</strong> which rock as hard as the classics.
      </p>
      <p>
        Simply open the Reason song files and <strong>copy your favorite note lanes</strong> into your track.
        To match note mappings of different plugins and Kong pad layouts we included <strong>5 versions of all of the patterns</strong>.
        Each version is available in a short and long variant.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thanks to these note mappings you can switch the Kong patch and use the <strong>oldschool sequences</strong> with the <strong>drum sets of today</strong>.
        Highly recommended is the combination with our successful <strong>Kong King patch pack</strong>.
