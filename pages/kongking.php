      <p>
        Kong is the state of the art <strong>drum machine in Reason</strong> and as we all know - <strong>no one</strong> can have enough drums.
        So Loop Depot is here to help...
      </p>
      <p>
        We created <strong>50 new high quality drum presets</strong> for your next production and bundled them in a pack with
        <strong>7 combinators</strong>. Fitted with this arsenal you are ready to <strong>spice up your drum patterns</strong> right away.
      </p>
      <p>
        All patches support <strong>all of the 16 pads</strong> of Kong. <strong>The button layout is consistent</strong> throughout the patches
        as well. So you can easily switch the selected preset without having a kick drum on your former hi-hat lane. Easy to use and easy to tweak.
      </p>
      <p>
        Last but not least - the patches include <strong>custom backdrops</strong> to give you the unique Kong King feeling.
