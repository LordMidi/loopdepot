        Kickdrum Synthesizer Collection
        <small> - Combinator 2 kick drum generators for Reason</small>
      </h1>
      <h3>DANGER - heavy bass!</h3>
      <p>
        Every music lives and dies by its bass drum.
        So it is important to find <strong>that specific kick</strong> that makes your track complete.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is not another library containing sampled kick drum files.
        This is a collection of four high quality Combinator 2 patches that <strong>generate kick drums</strong>, giving you full control of all relevant parameters.
        No matter if you need a high-pitched <strong>psychedelic kick</strong>, a subtle <strong>hip hop 808 boomer</strong> or a destroyed <strong>hardstyle monster bass</strong> -
        everything is possible with the Kickdrum Synthesizer Collection.
      </p>
      <p>
        Leveraging different algorithms, each machine has its own <strong>unique characteristic</strong>.
        The user interface consistently offers access to the base parameters: envelope, pitch, sweep, transient, low pass filter, low & high equalizer and volume control.
        Every patch additionally includes <strong>special modifiers</strong> to alter the sound even more.
