      </p>
      <h4>How to use:</h4>
      <p>
        <strong>The patches are made to be used as loops.</strong>
        Just create a note with one or two bars length and let the music play.
        That's it!
      </p>
      <p>
        It's very easy to create <strong>hypnotic electronic vibes</strong> with just a little bit of automation.
        All of the patches support the <strong>modulation wheel feature</strong> to increase the intensity of the sound.
        Absolutely recommended!
